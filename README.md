## Problem Statement

Create a comparator 



# Web App HTML

A front-end web application based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
and extended with [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/) style sheets and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)
task runner.


## Quick start

Clone the git repo:

```bash
git clone ...
cd .\<app directory>          # change the current directory to your project directory
npm install -g gulp # install gulp task runner globally, if you don't have it installed already
npm install         # install dev tools listed in the package.json file
```

Start a task runner to watch for modifications in source files and compile
modified files in the background:

```bash
gulp
```

And when you need to pull and merge the latest changes into your project, run:

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch base
git merge base/master
```
